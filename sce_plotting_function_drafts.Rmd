```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

```{r}
library(Seurat)
library(SingleCellExperiment)
library(DelayedArray)
library(HDF5Array)
library(DelayedMatrixStats)

library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)

# Directory for SingleCellExperiment HDF5 version 
# SCE object is derived from the Cancer Discovery Seurat object
hdf5Dir <-
  "data/sce_hdf5/"

sce <- loadHDF5SummarizedExperiment(dir = hdf5Dir)
```

# UMAP function

The code below is based on the Seurat::DimPlot function, while leaving lower-level functions intact (for now).

The version below is written for SingleCellExperiment objects only. Later, a combined function that accepts both Seurat and SCE objects will be created.

```{r}
# User arguments ####
reduction <- "umap"

#####
# 1. Define reduction, with default value
```
