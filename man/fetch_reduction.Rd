\title{Fetch reduction coordinates from single-cell objects}
\usage{
fetch_reduction(object, reduction, cells = NULL, dims = c(1, 2))

\method{fetch_reduction}{Seurat}(object, reduction, cells = NULL, dims = c(1, 2), ...)

\method{fetch_reduction}{SingleCellExperiment}(object, reduction, cells = NULL, dims = c(1, 2), ...)

\method{fetch_reduction}{AnnDataR6}(object, reduction, cells = NULL, dims = c(1, 2), ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{A single cell object. Currently, Seurat, SingleCellExpleriment,
and anndata objects are supported.}

\item{reduction}{the name of the reduction to pull coordinates from.}

\item{cells}{cell IDs for which to pull reduction data. If \code{NULL},
coordinates will be returned from all cells in the object. Cell IDs can be
generated with \code{\link[=fetch_cells]{fetch_cells()}}.}

\item{dims}{a numeric vector indicating the dimensions to pull. Currently,
only two dimensions are supported, but \code{\link[=fetch_data]{fetch_data()}} supports more than
two dimensions. For instructions on pulling more than two dimensions at
once, see the examples of \code{\link[=fetch_data]{fetch_data()}}.}
