\title{Pie charts for summarizing metadata in a single cell object}
\usage{
shiny_pie(
  object,
  patient_colname,
  group_by,
  palette = NULL,
  show_legend = TRUE,
  show_title = FALSE,
  plot_title = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{A single cell object. Currently, Seurat and
SingleCellExperiment objects are supported.}

\item{patient_colname}{The metadata column corresponding to the patient ID.
This is required to compute patient-level metadata.}

\item{group_by}{The metadata column to get patient count information for.
The pie chart will display the number of patients represented by each level
of this category.}

\item{palette}{The palette to use for coloring groups. If the palette passed
to this function is NULL, the default ggplot2 palette is used.}

\item{show_legend}{If TRUE, the legend is shown (default is TRUE)}

\item{show_title}{If TRUE, display a title above the plot. When TRUE, the
legend title is hidden, as the default legend title is equal to the default
plot title (the name of the group_by metadata column). The plot title can be
customized by supplying a string to \code{plot_title}.}

\item{plot_title}{If defined, the value entered will be displayed as the plot
title, if \code{show_title} is TRUE.}
}
\description{
shiny_pie summarizes the object by showing the number of patients/samples
represented by each level of a categorical metadata column (patient level, as
opposed to number of cells represented by each class).
