#' Fetch reduction coordinates from single-cell objects
#'
#' Returns the reduction coordinates matching the name and dimensions supplied.

#' See our GitHub.io website for additional information and examples.

#' @inheritParams object_param
#' @param reduction the name of the reduction to pull coordinates from.
#' @param cells cell IDs for which to pull reduction data. If `NULL`, 
#' coordinates will be returned from all cells in the object. Cell IDs can be 
#' generated with [`fetch_cells()`].
#' @param dims a numeric vector indicating the dimensions to pull. Currently, 
#' only two dimensions are supported, but [`fetch_data()`] supports more than 
#' two dimensions. For instructions on pulling more than two dimensions at 
#' once, see the examples of [`fetch_data()`].
